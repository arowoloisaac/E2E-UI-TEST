The Bug:
1. Passing a string which can be converted to numeric will generate error

2. in the function "test_input_no_solution" there was a bug there. since we have no solution because there is nothing
 in the array that can sum up to what will need, it won't prompt an result but was later resolved by using an if statement

3. in the function "test_with_empty_list" there is a bug, when the submit button is been clicked it doesn't go the next page
 because the array is empty but it will rather join to the existing HTML content by printing the result

4. in the function "test_with_single_length" there will be an error because nothing should be in the list(lst)
  because the expected result for a single element should be null if anything is inputted in the test fails


Not a bug Though
Note That, i was not able to pass send_keys through the text_content
except through input tag, that's why i used the input tag for it
